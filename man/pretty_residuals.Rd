\arguments{
\item{residuals}{A numeric vector of residuals from a model.}

\item{fv}{A numeric vector of fitted values from a model.}

\item{lp}{A numeric vector which defines the values of the linear predictor from a model.}

\item{vars}{A character vector which defines the names of variables in a dataframe (see \code{dat}, below) against which residuals will be plotted if \code{plot} includes option 5 (see below).}

\item{timestamp}{A character which defines the name of a variable in  \code{dat} which refers to timestamps. This is useful for models of data collected through time. If \code{NULL} and this plot is selected, \code{residuals} are plotted against an index for the selected data.}

\item{timestamp_fct}{(optional) A character which defines the name of a variable in \code{dat} which distinguishes independent timeseries. If \code{timestamp} is provided, it is desirable to plot the residuals ~ timestamp for only one of these levels (see \code{timestamp_fct_level}).}

\item{timestamp_fct_level}{An identifier of the independent timeseries in \code{timestamp_fct} to be plotted. If not provided, the function selects the longest timeseries.}

\item{dat}{A dataframe containing columns named as specified in \code{vars}. This should be the same dataframe that was used to fit the model from which residuals are extracted, although it can include extra variables not included in the model.}

\item{plot}{A numeric vector (1:7) which defines the plots to produce (see Details, below).}

\item{rand_pc}{A number which defines a percentage of residuals to plotted. If specified, a random subset of residuals, chosen according to a uniform distribution, are plotted. This is useful for some plots of residuals (e.g. residuals versus fitted values) which can be difficult to interpret with large datasets. However, note that some plots of residuals (e.g. quantile-quantile plots) respond poorly to selecting samples of residuals, and this option is not recommended in those cases - see \code{plot_rand_pc}, below.}

\item{plot_rand_pc}{A numeric input which defines which plots will use thinned residuals. This plots 3 - 6 by default (plots 1, 2 and 7 are still interpretable with large amounts of data.) The residual plot that corresponds to each plot number is explained in Details.}

\item{points_args}{A named list of arguments that is passed to \code{\link[graphics]{points}} to add points to appropriate plots.}

\item{lines_args}{A named list that is passed to \code{\link[graphics]{lines}} to add lines to appropriate plots.}

\item{pretty_axis_args}{A named list of arguments that is passed to \code{\link[prettyGraphics]{pretty_axis}} which is used to create pretty axes. For simplicity, this is implemented for most plots.}

\item{mtext_args}{A named list of arguments that is passed to \code{\link[graphics]{mtext}} to add labels to each plot. List names correspond to plot numbers (see Details). The default is a nested list which tries to add suitable labels in suitable locations to all plots, but this can be edited.}

\value{
Diagnostic plots of residuals.
}
\description{
This function produces (pretty) diagnostic plots of residuals. Plots can include standard diagnostic plots (i.e., residuals versus fitted values, residuals versus the linear predictor, a histogram of residuals and quantile-quantile plots), diagnostic plots for timeseries (i.e., timeseries of residuals and autocorrelation functions of residuals); and other helpful plots (i.e., residuals against factor levels/continuous covariates). For large datasets, these plots can be produced for random subsets of the data to aid interpretation.
}
\details{
Seven types of diagnostic plots can be produced: 1, a histogram of residuals; 2, a quantile-quantile plot; 3, residuals versus fitted values; 4, residuals versus linear predictor; 5, residuals against one or more user-defined variables; 6, residuals against a timestamp/index; 7, an autocorrelation function of residuals. \code{\link[prettyGraphics]{pretty_axis}} is used to control axes. This can be customised but changes affect all plots. Axis labels are implemented with \code{\link[graphics]{mtext}} via \code{mtext_args} to enable maximum user control over axes. The graphical characteristics of points and lines are specified in \code{points_args} and \code{lines_args}, respectively, and changes to these arguments affect all relevant plots. This implementation reflects a balance between user flexibility and simplicity.

#### Simulate and model data
set.seed(1)
x <- 1:1000
y <- rnorm(length(x), x*0.5, 30)
dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
dat$fct <- sample(1:2, size = nrow(dat), replace = TRUE)
dat$z <- rnorm(nrow(dat), dat$x*0.01, 50)
m1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = dat)

#### Plot residuals using default options
pp <- graphics::par(mfrow = c(3, 3))

#### Plot a single plot
pretty_residuals(residuals = stats::resid(m1), plot = 7)

#### Customisation of axes is via pretty_axis_args; changes affect most plots.
